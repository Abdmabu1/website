# Introduction

The Internet is a vast network that connects computers all over the world. Through the Internet, people can share information and communicate from anywhere with an Internet connection. It is one of the online platforms and modules that have been used by many people all over the world.  It has enabled the planet to be closer than it ever has (Small village).

## The question that many people ask however, is how the internet came to be.  

The internet’s creation cannot however be credited to one person, but rather a number of people who were able to make its inception possible.

# Thesis statement
To better understand the internet, one has to look at the brief history of the internet itself and also look at how it works in order to best understand it. 
To understand the internet better, one has to understand that the internet was not the work of one person, but rather the work of a number of people. For this reason, it can be termed as the information superhighway. 

Many people came up with different entities that have been characterized to be the internet and this was done by scientists.

The internet resulted as a work of a number of scientists who had anticipated that there would one day exist a worldwide network of information. 

Nikola Tesla can be remembered to be the one scientist who toyed with the idea of a wireless network at the beginning of the 20th century. 

Despite all these, scientists were for the idea of creating a database where there would be searchable systems of books and media in the 1930s and 1940s. 
All this however, were just postulations by these scientists and no real development ever came into fruition until 1960s (Andrews, 2013).  
The first tangible schematics of the internet were born in 1960 by a scientist from MIT, who popularized the idea of a supposed “intergalactic network”, that scientists later picked up and developed a concept of packet switching, a concept that enabled them to share electronic data.  
The sharing of electronic data in packets, is the one block through which the internet is built on. 

APRANET was the first workable prototype of the internet.  It stood for Advanced Research Projects Agency Network founded by the US department of defense in the 1960s. 
The first message to be sent by APRANET from one computer to the other was achieved on October 29 1969 (Andrews, 2013). 
In 1971, came the use of the email that used the symbol @ to separate the users name from the computer name. This computer name would later be called the domain name. 
With all these gaining ground, the dream of those who had envisioned a free book sharing platform was realized by project Gutenberg, in 1971, which allowed books to be shared electronically (Craig, 2010).  

The unprecedented growth of the internet would be seen in the years 1985-1995 as many more web-based programs and features would be launched. 
The booming of the internet can be credited to the invention of the DNS. It involved the use of TCP/IP. 
This domain caused a flurry of activity on the newly invented email system of sending messages. 
People adapted better to he internet as they were using it to send messages and to read news even though advanced knowledge was not available to the makers. 
A CERN employee Tim Berners lee however, cake up wit a idea n 1989 to link information, with a link so that it could be easier to find. 

This little advancement enabled people to create their own HTMLs that enabled them to create web pages, and so web pages grew in number and the world wide web was established (Media Museum, 2020). 
Knowing the history of the internet, it is prudent to ask how exactly the internet works. This is because over the last fifty to sixty years, the internet has become quite easy to use for many people around the world. 

The internet is an online platform that delivers and transmits a variety of data across different devices.  
Since its earlier idea involved wireless data transfer, the internet uses packet routing networks. 
These packet routing networks follow the internet protocol, or the transport control protocol commonly referred to as TCP and IP as mentioned earlier. 
These two protocols ensure that the internet is consistent and reliable and information can be accessed at any place regardless of the device that a person is using. 
As such the internet works by delivering messages. However, before these messages are delivered, they are broken down into packets, that travel from one source to the next using the aforementioned protocols (HP, 2019).

# Conclusion
In conclusion, internet is one of the best inventions in humanity. The amount of things you can do over the internet is extremely sensational. It is an absolute great tool to learn and communicate in just a click of a mouse or a swipe of a finger. The internet continues to grow day in and day out, as such it is defined by its past, and it helps to shape the future, while also making sure that the way it works follows privacy protocols that have been laid out. Its unrestricted accessibility, however, creates apprehension to young people who can access to it. Internet can expose these young minds to harmful uncensored videos or images that can cause various psychological influences; and over usage of computer can also lead to different kinds of physical and cognitive health problems. Internet can be really helpful and entertaining, but for those who do not know how to control it will just experience its harm and dark side.
